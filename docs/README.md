# Prism

### An automated analytics request auditing tool

### Preamble

Monitoring web analytics integration on a website is one of the most overlooked tasks when managing a site.
Yet, when the integration, not done right, has far-reaching consequences ranging from loss of critical user behavioral data to  security vulnerabilities, in some extreme cases.

The reason it gets overlooked often is because of lack of automation options in this area.  
Prism is an attempt at simplifying and automating this chore.
